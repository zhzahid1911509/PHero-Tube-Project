                Discuss the scope of <span class="border border-black rounded-md p-1 font-semibold">var</span>, <span class="border border-black rounded-md p-1 font-semibold">let</span>, and <span class="border border-black rounded-md p-1 font-semibold">const</span> 
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
            <p class="">In JavaScript, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed within the code. There are three types of scope: block scope, function scope, and global scope. The keywords `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they have different scoping rules. <br>

            `var` is function-scoped, meaning that if it is declared within a function, it can only be accessed within that function. If it is declared outside of any function, it has global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code. <br>
            
            `let` and `const`, on the other hand, are block-scoped. This means that if they are declared within a block (a section of code surrounded by `{}`), they can only be accessed within that block. If they are declared outside of any block, they have global scope.
            
            Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the difference:
            <div class="my-2">
              <pre>
                <code style="font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;">
      {
        let x = 2;
      }
      // x can NOT be used here
      
      {
          var x = 2;
      }
      // x CAN be used here
                </code>
              </pre>
            </div>
              
            
            In the first block, x is declared using let, so it can only be accessed within that block. In the second block, x is declared using var, so it can be accessed outside of the block as well.    
                </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-sky-200 mb-2">
            <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-2" /> 
            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                Tell us the use cases of <span class="border border-black rounded-md p-1 font-semibold">null</span> and <span class="border border-black rounded-md p-1 font-semibold">undefined</span> 
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p>In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are both used to represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different scenarios:

                - `undefined` is used when a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. For example, if we declare a variable `let x;` and then log it to the console with `console.log(x);`, we will get `undefined`.
                
                - `null` is an assignment value that represents no value or no object. It is used to indicate that a variable should have no value. For example, we might use null to indicate that a function argument is not being used, or to indicate the intentional absence of an object. <br>
                
                Here's an example:
                <div class="my-2">
                  <pre>
                    <code style="font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;">
      let myVar; // myVar is undefined
      console.log(myVar); // logs "undefined"

      myVar = null; // myVar is explicitly set to null
      console.log(myVar); // logs "null"
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                </div>
                
                
                In practical terms, when defining a variable that is meant to later hold an object, it is advisable to initialize the variable to `null` as opposed to anything else. That way, you can explicitly check for the value `null` to determine if the variable has been filled with an object reference at a later time.
                
                Remember, JavaScript treats `null` and `undefined` differently when using strict equality (`===`) and type-converting equality (`==`). For instance, while `null == undefined` is true, `null === undefined` is false.

                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p>A REST API, or REpresentational State Transfer API, is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that follows certain constraints of the REST architectural style. It allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

                Here are some key principles of REST APIs: <br>
                
                1. <b>Uniform Interface:</b> All API requests for the same resource should look the same, regardless of where the request comes from. <br>
                2. <b>Client-Server Decoupling:</b> In REST API design, client and server applications must be completely independent of each other. <br>
                3. <b>Statelessness:</b> REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include all the information necessary for processing it. <br>
                4. <b>Cacheability:</b> When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side. <br>
                5. <b>Layered System Architecture:</b> In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different layers. <br>
                
                REST APIs can be developed using virtually any programming language and support a variety of data formats. They provide a flexible and lightweight way to integrate applications and connect components in microservices architectures.
